# I-Simpa Scripts
Author: Kyle Brooks

## Description
A repository of python scripts written to make using funtions in I-Simpa easier

## all_reciever_tool
This tool is used to enable and disable the name tags on each punctual reciever to make viewing of the model easier.
### Planned Changes
* Removable Directivity Lines

## convert_all_tool
An edited version of a script that converts the gabe format files into csv. The changes made allow it to be used with python 3 as in the latest version of I-Simpa. 

## recp_res_tool
